TTG - Textual(temporary) Template Generator

TTG is a temporary hack until TG the syntatic and semantic solution is put in place.

    And normal text will be output by the generated template vode straight as it is.

        OS << "normal text";

    SUPERCODE Code blocks are output directly into the template function as it.

        {{ auto guard = generateGuardString(base_filepath + ".pg.h"); }}

    will result in the braced code being putput directly

        auto guard = generateGuardString(base_filepath + ".pg.h");

    Parameters are output as output into the template function

        (( parameter }}

    sas such

        OS << parameter;

    TABS and NEWLINES are output directly.
